abstract = {This paper evaluates the performance of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a fighting game AI and proposes an improvement for the algorithm. Most existing fighting game AIs rely on rule bases and react to every situation with predefined actions, making them predictable for human players. We attempt to overcome this weakness by applying MCTS, which can adapt to different circumstances without relying on predefined action patterns or tactics. In this paper, an AI based on Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT) and MCTS is first developed. Next, the paper proposes improving the AI with Roulette Selection and a rule base. Through testing and evaluation using FightingICE, an international fighting game AI competition platform, it is proven that the aforementioned MCTS-based AI is effective in a fighting game, and our proposed improvement can further enhance its performance.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is applied to control the player character in a clone of the popular platform game Super Mario Bros. Standard MCTS is applied through search in state space with the goal of moving the furthest to the right as quickly as possible. Despite parameter tuning, only moderate success is reached. Several modifications to the algorithm are then introduced specifically to deal with the behavioural pathologies that were observed. Two of the modifications are to our best knowledge novel. A combination of these modifications is found to lead to almost perfect play on linear levels. Furthermore, when adding noise to the benchmark, MCTS outperforms the best known algorithm for these levels. The analysis and algorithmic innovations in this paper are likely to be useful when applying MCTS to other video games.},
